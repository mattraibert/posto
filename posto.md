todo
----

1. brainstorm mode, where each line is a todo
2. 'start' should checkout, initial commit to a feature branch
3. convert to thor or boson
4. make a list of unuseful features to delete
5. git commit after each operation(?)
6. 'bump' command to push todo priority by one
7. replace 'quick' with 'tag'
8. sync list to trello
9. only sort new todos against top 5 (3?)
* fix empty todo file bug
* init should commit saying 'begin using posto'
* get rid of 'done' and 'add'
* unsort should commit saying 'backlogged'
* rename 'commit' to 'finish'
* 'commit/finish' should merge feature branch into master and cleanup
* 'sort/resort' should commit something helpful
