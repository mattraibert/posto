todo
----

1. oops always works (even for non posto commits)
2. add without quotation marks
3. make a list of unuseful features to delete
* 'bump' command to push todo priority by one
* replace 'quick' with 'tag'
* sync list to trello
* only sort new todos against top 5 (3?)
* allow partial sort/quit in the middle
* brainstorm mode, where each line is a todo
* 'start' should checkout, initial commit to a feature branch
* convert to thor or boson
* git commit after each operation(?)
* posto log alias for git lg
